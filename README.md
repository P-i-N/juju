## 📖 Full Feature List

### 🔗 Graph view

- Compact graph view  
  ![compact graph dark theme](images/compact-view.png) ![compact graph light theme](images/compact-view-light.png)
  - Alternative: [Extended graph view](images/full-view.png)
- High information density
- Author name omitted if it's your own change
- Elided commits
- Select a change to see its affected files and diffs
- Select multiple changes with shift-click (contiguous range from the last clicked change) or ctrl-click (individual
  changes, cmd-click on macOS)
- Compare two selected changes with a diff or interdiff
- Create merge changes by selecting multiple changes and then pressing the "+" button
- Drag & drop changes onto other changes
- Show each commit's changed files in the graph (like `jj log -s`) behind an expand arrow next to the commit. Click a
  file to open its diff, or drag it onto another change to move its changes there (⚠️ experimental, disable with
  `juju.showChangedFiles`)
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown`: Move the selection by one change
  - `Shift` + `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown`: Extend the selection by one change, like a `Shift` + click
  - `Enter`: Open the selected change like a double click; with multiple selected changes, create a new change with all
    of them as parents
  - `Delete`: Abandon the selected change(s), with confirmation
  - `n`: Create a new change on top of the selected change(s), with all of them as parents
  - `i`: Open the details view for the current selection
  - `d`: Describe the last selected change
  - `e`: Edit the last selected change
  - `b`: Create a bookmark on the last selected change
  - `t`: Create a tag on the last selected change
  - `s`: Split the last selected change
  - `ArrowRight` / `ArrowLeft`: Expand/collapse the changed files of the selected change(s) (with
    `juju.showChangedFiles`)

### 🖱️ Context menu

- Right click on a change for a context menu  
  ![context menu](images/context-menu.png)

- Split the change into two changes
- Abandon one or more changes (select multiple with shift-click or ctrl-click)

### ✋ Drag & drop operations

- Move bookmarks by dragging them onto a target change
- Rebase one or more changes (with or without descendants) onto/after/before any other change

## 🐛 Known issues

If you encounter any problems, please [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/P-i-N/juju/issues/)!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Double modification annotations ("M, M") in file explorer

If you see annotations like "M, M" next to files, this is caused by VS Code's built-in Git extension running alongside
Juju. To disable Git, disable `git.enabled` in your VS Code settings.

### Slow diff

Some file diffs or merges load very slowly. This is a known VS Code issue where VS Code's internal diff algorithm takes
an unusually long time for certain diffs.

You can verify that it's VS Code and not Juju by opening the same diff with `code --diff <file-a> <file-b>`.

Workarounds:

- Wait a few seconds; VS Code automatically stops the diff early after 5 seconds
- Set `diffEditor.diffAlgorithm` and `mergeEditor.diffAlgorithm` to "legacy"

### Other performance issues

If you experience performance issues, try these steps:

- Disable `juju.enableAnnotations`, blame annotations are expensive to compute for large repos
- Lower `juju.logLimit` to show fewer commits in the graph
