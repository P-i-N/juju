/**
 * Runs `attempt` (a read pinned to a fixed operation) and, if it fails because the operation heads
 * are divergent, retries once after a randomized backoff. If the heads are still divergent after the
 * retry, runs `reconcile` (a read at head that makes jj merge the divergent heads into a new
 * operation) exactly once.
 *
 * The caller-supplied `delay` resolves the backoff promise; the caller controls cancellation
 * (e.g. via a vscode.CancellationToken) by resolving early. The randomization of the delay breaks
 * the phase-lock between multiple Juju instances sharing one repository, so their reconciliations
 * cannot sustain a cascade.
 *
 * `maxRetries` controls how many delay+recheck cycles happen before reconciling. The default of 1
 * gives a single ~BASE_MS backoff (~250 ms), keeping user-visible latency low while still letting
 * another process reconcile first. Higher values add exponential backoff (BASE_MS * 2^i) for
 * scenarios where simultaneous collisions are likely.
