# Change Log

## 0.1.0

First release of Juju, a fork of [Jujutsu X](https://github.com/Christoph-D/jjx).

### New Features

- **Expandable commits** - Changes in the graph expand to show the files they touch, grouped by directory, with the same
  file actions as the Source Control view, including discarding changes of selected files
- **Dragging changed files** - Drag changed files onto another change to move their changes there, or `Ctrl`+drop them
  onto an edge to move them into a new change at that place
- **Inserting changes in between** - `Ctrl`+drag a change onto an edge to rebase it exactly there, or
  `Ctrl`+double-click an edge to insert a new empty change
- **Graph in an editor tab** - Open the graph in a regular editor tab that stays in sync with the graph in the side bar
- **New double-click action** - Double-clicking a change runs `jj edit` on changes without a description and `jj new`
  otherwise
- **Bookmark drag preview** - Dragged bookmarks are highlighted and previewed on the drop target

### Changes

- Settings use the `juju.` prefix
- Commands, views, context keys, colors, and the virtual file system scheme (`juju://`) use Juju-specific IDs, so Juju
  can be installed alongside Jujutsu X
- The graph, Source Control view, and operation log are refreshed from a single repository snapshot

## Jujutsu X History

The entries below are the change log of Jujutsu X up to the point where Juju was forked.

## 1.16.2

### New Features

- **Push to Selected Remote** - The graph view's "Fetch & Push..." submenu now offers a "Push to Selected Remote..."
  action with a quick pick for push flags (`--tracked`, `--all`, `--deleted`)
- **Cancel remote operations** - Clicking the spinning syncing icon during a fetch or push started from the graph view
  command bar cancels the ongoing operation

## 1.16.1

### Bug Fixes

- **Reset filesystem watchers on refresh** - Refreshing a view now disposes and re-creates file system watchers, so
  broken or incomplete watchers recover automatically

### Internal

- Pin release workflow GitHub Actions by commit SHA
- Update GitHub Actions versions in CI
- Update pnpm to 12.4.2
- Remove unnecessary config from devcontainer

## 1.16.0

### New Features

- **More compact graph layout** - Lines connecting to shared parent commits now merge towards the left, more closely
  matching the `jj` CLI graph layout
- The colocated jj/git repository warning now offers an "Open Global Settings" action in addition to "Open Folder
  Settings"

### Bug Fixes

- Fix minor visual glitches in the highlighting of connections in the graph view
- Increase the tool tip delay to 600ms

## 1.15.2

### New Features

- Right-clicking a change now offers "Show Details..." to view commit details

### Performance

- Make graph view selection updates sub-linear in row count

### Internal

- Re-copy static webview assets in watch mode so edits to HTML files, `config.toml`, and codicons reach the extension
  host without a manual rebuild
- Enable react-hooks lint rules for webview code
- Fix new lint errors and other minor issues in the preact components

## 1.15.1

### New Features

- **Auto-switch the selected repository based on the active editor** - In multi-root workspaces, the repository shown in
  the JJ Graph and Operation Log views now follows the active editor. Disable it with the new `jjx.autoSwitchRepository`
  setting

## 1.15.0

### New Features

- **Details view for selected change** - Add a commit details view similar to `jj show`, reachable by clicking the info
  icon at the top of the graph view or by pressing `i` in the graph view
- **Keyboard shortcuts in the graph view**: See README.md for the list of shortcuts
- **Shortest change ID in annotations** - Blame annotations now include a short change ID

### Bug Fixes

- **Split**: Fix splitting a change with a modified executable file so it no longer produces rogue mode changes
- **Repository**: Store rename sources as absolute paths so operations such as discard work when the extension host runs
  from a different working directory

### Internal

- Update dependencies
- Update the minimum required VS Code version to 1.125
- Update the Playwright devcontainer image to 1.62.1
- Remove the unused `change_id_short` template field and unused template aliases from `config.toml`

## 1.14.2

### New Features

- **Changed-file context menu in the graph view** - Right-clicking a changed file in the graph view now opens a context
  menu similar to the files in the SCM view

### Bug Fixes

- Hide the commit detail popup while a context menu is open
- Omit the Open File menu entry for deleted files outside the working copy

## 1.14.1

### Internal

- Split the release workflow into parallel GitHub Release and Marketplace publishing jobs so they can be retried
  independently

## 1.14.0

### New Features

- **Range in the graph view** - Shift+click now selects a range of changes. Selecting individual changes moved to
  Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS)
- **Editable working-copy side for parent-commit diffs** - Opening the diff of a parent-commit file that is unchanged in
  the working copy now shows the editable working-copy file on the right side

### Bug Fixes

**Conflict handling**

- Fall back to a plain editor for conflicts with more than 2 sides
- Perform the standard click action instead of opening the merge editor for conflicted files in a selected commit
  because such conflicts cannot be merged in the working copy
- Show conflicted file status correctly in the selected commit
- Show conflicted file status correctly in the graph view for changed files
- Show the conflict badge for files whose path casing differs on case-insensitive file systems

**Merge editor side titles**

- Use the shortest change IDs in merge editor side titles
- Disambiguate divergent changes in merge editor side titles
- Parse conflict marker labels for changes without a description

**Editor titles**

- Show the short change ID in file-at-revision editor titles so they match the corresponding diff editor titles

**File paths**

- Fix path case normalization on macOS for file decorations
- Preserve file names containing literal backslashes on macOS and Linux instead

**Graph view and menus**

- Move Add/Remove Parent items to the end of the Rebase With Descendants submenu
- Show "All" in rebase menu labels for multi-selection
- Better align the status letters of changed files

**SCM view**

- Show repo-relative paths instead of absolute paths when the workspace root is a symlinked directory

**Performance**

- Memoize `show()`/`showAll()` results per (revset, operation id) so concurrent resolution of the same revision spawns
  at most one `jj log` process

### Internal

- **More robust path handling** - Distinguish resolved and workspace-folder paths in the type system

## 1.13.0

### New Features

- **Interactive `jj split`** - A new "Split" action in the graph context menu runs `jj split` interactively.
- **Workspace pill context menu** - Right-click a workspace pill to forget the workspace (optionally deleting its
  directory) or copy its path.

### Bug Fixes

- Make custom context-menu text non-selectable so menu items cannot be accidentally highlighted or drag-selected

### Internal

- **Read diff-tool snapshots from disk** - The `jjx-vscode-diff` subprocess now reports only its snapshot directory
  paths; the extension reads the files it needs directly from disk instead of serializing whole file trees as base64
  JSON over IPC. This removes per-file serialization and speeds up single-file diffs and the Split view.

## 1.12.6

### Bug Fixes

- **Delete untracked directories recursively** - Deleting an untracked directory from the SCM view now removes it and
  its contents recursively (after confirmation)

## 1.12.5

### New Features

- **Drag & drop multiple selected changes** - Select multiple changes to rebase/squash/etc. them all at once
- **Immutable icon on destructive context menu items** - Context menu items that modify the target change now show an
  immutable icon

## 1.12.4

### Bug Fixes

- **Track untracked directories recursively** - Tracking an untracked directory from the SCM view now tracks its
  contents recursively instead of failing silently.

## 1.12.3

### New Features

- **Cancel in-flight push of bookmarks/tags** - While a bookmark or tag is being pushed (spinning indicator shown),
  dragging the pill is disabled and its context menu is replaced with a single "Cancel Push" action. Cancelling kills
  the running `jj`/`git` push child process.
- **Cancel in-flight deletion of remote bookmarks/tags** - While a bookmark or tag is being deleted from a remote, the
  remote-ref pill shows a "Deleting..." spinner and offers a "Cancel Deletion" action that aborts the running process.

### Bug Fixes

- (Only jj 0.44+) Track a tag on a remote before pushing it there, so pushing a tag to a second, untracked remote
  succeeds
- Show the spinning indicator when initiating a push from the bookmark/tag pill context menu

## 1.12.2

### Bug Fixes

- **Clean short change IDs** - Render correctly computed short change IDs everywhere: graph, source control, editor
  titles, quick-picks, and confirmation dialogs
- **Diff editor titles** - Unify and improve diff editor titles
- **Toggle Diff View** - Support toggling added-file diffs
- Make the working copy side editable in from/to diffs
- Ignore double-click on elided graph nodes

### Internal

- **Type-safe change IDs** - Replace raw `string` change IDs with proper types throughout the protocol, extension host,
  and webview
- Route extension↔webview messages through typed `postMessage` wrappers

## 1.12.1

### New Features

- **Consistent local tag pill context menu** - Right-clicking a local tag pill now shows a unified menu independent of
  the jj version, allowing pushing the tag to remotes and deleting the local tag. Tag tracking, supported by jj 0.44+,
  is used internally but not surfaced in this menu.

### Bug Fixes

- Maintain the force-refresh flag when coalescing update checks in `checkForUpdates`
- Fall back to the active editor URI for the Open Parent/Child Change commands when the resource argument is undefined,
  fixing a timing-dependent race (most visible on Windows) where the editor stayed on the working copy
- Raise the diff-tool subprocess timeout for slow Windows CI

### Internal

- Shard integration test workflows to reduce runtime
- Add a helper script to extract the test log from a downloaded Playwright HTML report

## 1.12.0

### New Features

- **Remote bookmark/tag pill context menu** - Right-clicking a remote bookmark or tag pill (`<name>@<remote>`) now opens
  a context menu with remote-specific actions such as deleting a locally-deleted bookmark from the remote.
- **Tag tracking on remotes (jj 0.44+)** - Tags now support tracking on remotes, mirroring bookmarks. Older jj versions
  keep the previous behavior of pushing tags directly via `git push`.
- **From/to diff for two-change selection** - Selecting two changes in the graph now shows a from/to diff
  (`jj diff --from --to`) by default instead of an interdiff. A button toggles the diff to an interdiff.
- **Allow immutable changes as drag sources** - Immutable changes can now be used as drag sources in the graph.

### Bug Fixes

- Prompt before modifying immutable commits when using Duplicate and Revert drag&drop, consistent with other
  target-modifying operations
- Show an "immutable" icon in the rebase menu items to indicate operations that are guaranteed to change immutable
  changes
- Use modal dialogs for all confirmation prompts for consistency
- Hide the Open Parent/Child Change buttons in complex (two-change) diffs where they are meaningless

## 1.11.0

### New Features

- **Toggle Diff View command** - A new "Toggle Diff View" command switches the active editor between a file view and a
  diff view, replacing the separate "View as File" and "View as Diff" commands with a single toggle.

## 1.10.1

### Bug Fixes

- Force a full refresh of the SCM view when clicking the "Refresh" button
- Refresh the SCM view when deleting an untracked file
- Hide the "Select Repository" button in the graph and operation log views when only one repository exists
- Remove an unnecessary warning log emitted during normal diff operations

## 1.10.0

### New Features

- **Handle untracked files in the SCM view** - Show files that jj does not ignore but also does not track (e.g. files
  exceeding jj's max file size or excluded by `snapshot.auto-track`) in a new "Untracked Files" section below the
  working copy.

### Bug Fixes

- Surface jj export-failure warnings (e.g. "Failed to export some bookmarks") as a VS Code warning popup
- Fix failures with bookmark/tag/workspace names containing special characters
- Escape invisible characters in bookmark/tag/workspace names in the graph view
- Show an error in the graph webview when a refresh fails, instead of leaving a stale graph visible
- Use `operation.attributes()` instead of `operation.tags()`, the latter was deprecated in jj 0.41

### Internal

- Rename source and test files to kebab-case
- Remove unnecessary exports

## 1.9.2

### New Features

- **Add and remove parents via drag and drop** - Quickly modify a change's parents with drag&drop through a new item
  under the "Rebase With Descendants" submenu.

### Bug Fixes

- Handle binary files in the diff tool IPC, which fixes diff view of images
- Clear the "Selected Change" and "Interdiff" sections in the change view after abandoning changes
- Keep the "Selected Commit" and "Interdiff" resource groups below the "Parent Commits" group

## 1.9.1

### Bug Fixes

- Include the change in the abandon confirmation dialog
- Return per-URI size and mtime from `JJFileSystemProvider.stat()`
- Keep cache entries alive for open `jj://` diff documents instead of evicting them after three minutes

### Internal

- Add integration tests for multi-root workspace/repository selection, the colocated repo warning, abandoning changes,
  and the absorb change command
- Increase the integration test worker count from 4 to 5
- Inline the esbuild problem matcher instead of relying on an extension dependency
- Some cleanups

## 1.9.0

### New Features

- **Compare two changes with an interdiff** - Shift-select two changes in the graph to see an "Interdiff" section in the
  change view (`jj interdiff`), with side-by-side diffs showing how the selected changes differ.

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent operation reconciliation cascades on shared repositories (e.g. a host and a VM over virtiofs). This fixes the
  symptom of the op log quickly growing to hundreds of MB when two Jujutsu X instances were pointed at the same repo
- Trim files included in the vsix

### Internal

- Remove unnecessary dependencies

## 1.8.7

### Bug Fixes

- Forward `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `SSH_AGENT_PID` to `jj` invocations so agent-based SSH authentication works

- Vertically align nodes with commit message in the graph
- Restrict environment forwarded to `jj` invocations to prevent unexpected behavior

### Internal

  selectors instead of cross-module CSS class queries
- Harden integration tests against races

## 1.8.5

### New Features

- **Conflict indicators** - Conflicts are shown in both the graph view and change view
- **VS Code merge editor** - Open the merge editor to resolve conflicts directly
- **Conflicted files** - Shown with "X" indicator in the change view

#### Divergent Changes Support

- Full support for divergent changes in the graph and change views
- Include change offset in section headers for divergent changes
- All meaningful operations work on divergent changes

#### Bookmark & Tag Management

- **Create** bookmarks and tags via context menu
- **Move** bookmarks with confirmation when moving backwards/sideways
- **Delete** bookmarks and tags
- Show local and remote bookmarks/tags separately
- Show the synced status for bookmarks/tags

#### Multi-Workspace Support

- Workspace labels shown in the graph for multi-workspace repos
- Handles "workspace is stale" errors with a button to update

#### Operation Management

- **Undo/Redo buttons** - Quick access to undo/redo in the operations log view
- **Browse operations** - View the full operations log

#### Workflow Support

- **Squash workflow** - Support for `jj new` as an alternative to edit mode (`jjx.changeEditAction`)
- **Edit workflow** - Traditional edit workflow fully supported
- **Commit action** - Separate configuration option for commit behavior (`jjx.commitAction`)

#### File Annotations

- Fetch the annotations of all selected lines at once for better performance when multi-cursor editing
- Cache annotations when selected lines don't change

### Usability Improvements

#### Graph View Enhancements

- **Default compact style** - Compact graph view is now the default
- **Default revset** - Matches `jj log` default revset
- **Increased limit** - Default graph view limit increased to 100 changes
- **Minimal change IDs** - Show minimal unambiguous change IDs, at least 4 characters
- **Empty commits** - Shown as `(empty)`
- **Working copy** - Highlighted with a larger `@` symbol
- **Bookmarks/tags** - Shown as pills, abbreviated if long
- **Beziér curves** - Smooth connections between adjacent columns

#### Context Menus

- **Abandon change** - With confirmation dialog
- **Describe change** - Opens full editor instead of one-line input
- **Copy change ID** - Quick copy to clipboard
- **Create bookmark/tag** - Create from context menu
- Better positioning to fit in viewport
- Closes on focus loss

#### Confirmation Dialogs

- Ask for confirmation when abandoning/discarding changes
- Ask for confirmation when moving bookmarks backwards/sideways

#### Editor Integration

- Full editor for `jj describe` instead of single-line input
- Removed timeout when entering long commit messages
- Snapshot working copy on explicit refresh

#### Configuration

Configuration prefix changed from `jjk` to `jjx`. New configuration options:

- `jjx.changeEditAction` - Action when clicking the edit button on a change (`edit` or `new`)
- `jjx.commitAction` - Action when pressing Ctrl+Enter in the source control input box (`commit` or `new`)
- `jjx.graphStyle` - Display style for commits in the graph view (`full` or `compact`, default: `compact`)
- `jjx.pollInterval` - Interval in milliseconds between repository polls (default: 30000, set to 0 to disable)
- `jjx.openDiffAction` - Action when clicking a file in the change view (`diff` or `file`)
- `jjx.elideImmutableCommits` - Elide chains of immutable commits in the graph view (default: `true`)

Removed: `jjk.ignoreWorkingCopy` (now handled automatically)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed "Describe change" button for "Selected Commit"
- Fixed polling performance issue with throttling
- Fixed memory leak in `JJFileSystemProvider.dispose()`
- Fixed watching the real repo when in a jj workspace
- Fixed handling of `--ignore-working-copy` automatically
- Fixed handling of hidden change status for proper display
- Fixed handling of change_offset for non-divergent commits (prevents duplicate change IDs in graph)
- Fixed injection of `--config-file` before `--` in commands
- Removed obsolete jj version check

### Performance Improvements

- **JSON output** - All `jj log` invocations now use JSON parsing instead of brittle colored text parsing
- **Template builder** - Centralized JJ template string generation for consistent JSON output
- **Caching** - File annotations cached when selected lines don't change
- **Debouncing** - Repository polling debounced for better performance
- **Extension activation** - Only activates in jj repositories
- **Polling** - Configurable interval with throttling

### Architecture & Code Quality

- Split `repository.ts` into smaller, more maintainable files
- Centralized error handling
- Extracted hardcoded timeouts to central constants
- Removed winston logging framework in favor of native VS Code logging
- New lane assignment algorithm for better graph layout
- Added AGENTS.md for AI assistant context
- Set up Prettier for code formatting
- Devcontainer setup for development

### Other Changes

- **New logo** - Fresh branding for Jujutsu X
- **License** - Changed to AGPL-3.0 (original Jujutsu Kaizen code remains MIT)
- **CI/CD** - Added CI and publish workflows
- Extension registered as "Jujutsu" SCM provider
- Set `extensionKind: workspace` for remote development support
